# ConvAI - Smart Memory Chat App

> AI chat that remembers and understands conversation context using vector embeddings and semantic search.

ðŸ”— **[Live Demo](https://conv-ai-six.vercel.app)** | ðŸš€ **[Backend API](https://convai-production.up.railway.app)**

## Key Features

**User Authentication System**

JWT-based authentication with secure user registration and login. Implemented route protection and user session management with isolated conversation spaces.

**Intelligent Memory Architecture**

Built a two-tier memory system combining recent conversation context with semantic search across conversation history. Uses vector embeddings to retrieve relevant past discussions, enabling contextual responses that improve over time.

**Document Processing Pipeline**

Developed multi-format document parser supporting PDF, DOCX, and TXT files. Implements intelligent text chunking, vector embedding generation, and semantic search to enable AI responses based on uploaded document content.

**Real-time Chat Interface**

Integrated OpenAI GPT-3.5 with custom context management. Each conversation maintains session tracking while leveraging personalized conversation history for enhanced response quality.

**Performance Optimization**

Designed background processing architecture for memory storage operations. Users receive immediate responses while conversation indexing and vector storage occur asynchronously.

**Full-Stack Implementation**

React frontend with protected routing and token-based authentication. FastAPI backend with automated API documentation, Pinecone vector database integration, and SQLite user management.
